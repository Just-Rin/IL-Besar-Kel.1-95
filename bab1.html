    ABSTRACT
  </h1>
  <h2 data-aos="fade-up">The Beauty and Highlight of the Journey Through Mallika</h2>
  <h3 data-aos="fade-up">By recycling our materials, we create a healthier planet for ourselves and future generations.
    <span>In 2024, Indonesia was ranked 2nd for having the most plastic waste in the world.</span> Hearing that, we as the younger
    generation should be more aware of our actions about plastic waste. That is why we, as students of Saint Ursula
    middle school, made our products for this project with reuse, recycling, and reduction. <span>All of our products were
    made according to the needs of our earth.</span> This project aimed to promote sustainability by implementing the
    principles of reuse, recycling, and reduction in a student-led bazaar. In this Integrated Learning Project (ILP),
    our team set out to create products that blended the worlds of science and art, with the goal of showcasing the
    intersection of both in an engaging and innovative way.
  </h3>
  <h3 data-aos="fade-up"><span>Our group landed on our stand being themed around beaches in Bali</span> along with the name ‘Mallika’
    which means jasmine in sanskrit. We then decided to use a bright color scheme and started working on our logo. The
    combination of sun, sand, and ocean seamlessly came together, shaping the overall concept. Mallika came as a name
    that represents the identity of the store. Mallika in the Sanskrit language means jasmine. Jasmine not only
    identifies the beautiful Bali region but jasmine also has a deep meaning of sincerity and beauty. Sincere in serving
    customers and giving the beauty of Bali in the products.
  </h3>
  <h3 data-aos="fade-up">We decided to make two distinct items for our bazaar: a biotechnology-based scented lip balm
    and a hand-sewn batik scrunchie. <span>Both products were thoughtfully chosen to represent our creativity</span> and the lessons
    we’ve learned about both scientific principles and artistic craftsmanship. <span>The scented lip balm was inspired by the
    concept of biotechnology, while the batik scrunchie was selected to highlight the beauty of traditional art.</span> The
    process of developing these products allowed us to apply our knowledge of biology, chemistry, and design, all while
    dealing with the challenges of hands-on production. This project taught us the value of experimentation, planning,
    collaboration, and problem-solving. There are many failures before perfection, especially the biotech products. <span>In
    particular, it required extensive trials to purify used cooking oil. Creating a tapioca solution, heating the oil at
    a precise temperature, and then filtering it through multiple layers of paper towels was involved in the cleansing
    process. The process took a considerable amount of time and was crucial to achieve the clearance as desired.</span>
  </h3>
  <h3 data-aos="fade-up"><span>The first time we made the lip balm, however, we encountered a challenge with the proportions.</span>
    We added too much beeswax and fragrance, which led to a lip balm that was far too hard and had an overpowering
    scent. The overwhelming scent, while pleasant, made the lip balm less wearable, and the excess beeswax made it too
    stiff. To resolve this, we decided to reduce the amount of beeswax and scent in future batches, achieving a more
    balanced and smoother result. This mistake highlighted the importance of measuring ingredients carefully and
    adjusting recipes based on trial and error, which is a common process in biotechnology. <span>The success of the lip balm
    ultimately came from making adjustments to our initial mixture, and by the end, we were able to produce a product
    that was not only functional but also environmentally friendly, thanks to the careful selection of ingredients.</span>
  </h3>
  <h3 data-aos="fade-up">During the week of the bazaar, we each had our own assignments. As the day got closer, we got
    more prepared and more busy. <span>Since the bazaar event was split into two days,</span> we only had to sell products for one of
    them, <span>the other was used for our performance.</span> The day before the art performance, we practiced our dance
    choreography. It went pretty smoothly, we also planned our costumes for the dance. <span>A simple black t-shirt and black
    pants with batik clothes as an accessory were chosen to be our dance costume.</span> The PE performance happened to take
    place while the area was busy and thankfully none of the moves were forgotten, the drama however started when that
    day's bazaar was almost over. We didn’t really have an audience but the performance itself went great.</h3>
  <h3 data-aos="fade-up">The day of the bazaar, we went to school early in the morning to tweak some stuff on our booth,
    like our photobooth, our table decorations, and some of the sample products that were displayed so buyers could see.
    It was hectic from morning to afternoon, with people running around, making sales, and calling to promote their
    products to customers. It was hard to maintain concentration and keep an eye on each product we sold. But, that was
    the valuable lesson of this entire product. Which was teamwork, hard work, and management. Though we were told to
    start selling our products at 11 AM, but at 9 AM we had a lot of buyers wanting to buy our products. So, we were
    unprepared for the crowd and couldn’t handle all of it because we didn't expect it to open at 9 AM. <span>After the crowd
    died down, preparations for the second break were immediately started by us so we would be prepared.</span>
  </h3>
  <h3 data-aos="fade-up">In conclusion, this project was a valuable learning experience that allowed us to explore both
    biotechnology and traditional art. Although the bazaar may seem easy on paper, we as a group have gone through so
    much together. In this time we’ve learned the importance of teamwork and problem solving. This whole thing was
    definitely a new experience for me as I had never done anything like this bazaar before. Sometimes we may have
    misunderstandings or mishaps but in the end we still could work together.
